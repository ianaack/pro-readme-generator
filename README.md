## Description

This application will generate a professional README.md file using node.js, based on the user's input for a new project. The user's input will be captured using the Inquirer module from npm, and the file will be generated using the file system (fs) module built into node.js. The README.md file will include the title of the project, and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. Some of these sections are optional.

## Instructions
git clone this project to your preferred IDE, open the integrated terminal at the root folder, run "node index.js" and fill out the prompts. 
Once everything has been answered, your README.md file will be generated in the 'output' folder for you to copy/move to the appropriate project.
